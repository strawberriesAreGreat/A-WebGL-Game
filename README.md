# WEBGL Game using Vaniala JS, CSS, and WebGL

![Game Screenshot](game.gif)

This game is a really simple and crude implemenation of a 'cookie-clicker' type of game. The goal is the kill as many bacteria colonies as your can before one of them gets too big.

## Technical Insights

This game was devloped in order to gain technical insights and experience with WebGL:

- **Shader Programming**: I utilized vertex and fragment shaders to produce basic polygons

- **Real-time Collision Detection**: I implemented a crude (and partially broken) collision detection algorithms to ensure realistic interactions between game objects.

- **WebGL Debugging**: Debugging was a challenge with WebGL when first attempting to get shaders working properly

- **Handling Game Events**: Interactivity was achieved with user events

## Play the Game

To experience the Super Awesome WebGL Game, simply clone the repo and launch the home.html page in a browser. Its not the most fun game to play :/

## TODO

Things I ought to do, if I ever touch this project again:

- [ ] Refactor all the code, it really needs to be cleaned up
- [ ] get antibiotics to work again (it was depricated during some refactoring and is currently broken)
- [ ] add complexity to the algorithm that dictates the rate at which bacteria spawn
- [ ] Move over to typescript
